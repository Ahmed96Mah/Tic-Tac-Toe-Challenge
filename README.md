# A Tic-Tac-Toe game Challenge

## Project Description

**Responsive** Tic-Tac-Toe game with a mobile-first approach.

### Operational Steps:

1- Both players should choose their symbol (X or O) **first**. If a click is detected on the grid before that an alret is
displayed for the players **prompting them to provide their choices**.

2- Once both players provide their selections, players' turns are highlighted above the grid based on the current turn.

3- After that, the first grid-click initiates the game. Note: **An alret is displayed if a player attempts to change their symbol-selection while the game is underway**.

4- When a win occurs, a line is drawn through the winning path to highlight it.

5- A sentence "Game Over" is displayed to declare the end of the game. After that the grid, players' selections and turns are cleared to prepare the page for a new game. Note: **The win counter for the winner is increased by a point**.
